# ABOUT ME 
Hi, I’m Christian, a Software Engineering student at WGU. 

I’m transitioning into tech after several years working across healthcare, logistics, and insurance. Before beginning my software path, I earned my B.S. in Chemistry and built experience in environments where precision and problem-solving matter, skills I now bring to my development work.

My background has given me strong foundations in problem-solving, a skill I now bring to my development work. As I progress through my degree, I’m building projects that reinforce my growth as a software engineer.
