Taniti Island Tourism Website

A UI/UX design and front-end development project created for a fictional tropical island destination. This site was developed from initial concept through wireframing and prototyping, demonstrating responsive layout design, interactive navigation, and user-focused structure.

🔍 Project Overview

This project involved designing a multi-page tourism website for a fictional destination called Taniti Island. The process included creating low-fidelity wireframes and then building a fully styled interactive prototype using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The focus was on clear navigation, visual appeal, and organizing travel information into intuitive categories such as planning, activities, and user favorites.
